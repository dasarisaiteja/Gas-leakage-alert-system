# Gas-leakage-alert-system
Gas leaks, especially from LPG, pose serious risks.
By using Arduino uno and MQ-8 gas detecting sensor we developed a Gas leakage alert system.
This system activates an alarm (buzzer) when gas levels exceed safety limits.
It helps prevent accidents and protect lives in homes, hostels, and industries.
